\chapter{Introduction}

This report outlines the planning activities for the Habtoor Island Project.

The resort consists of three hotels and interconnecting Podia and parkings.

\section{Initial Targets}

Our initial target is to plan the works in a manner that can enable the early start of activities in the basements and Towers. As these constitute approximately 70\%  of the works it will enable site works to start as quickly as possible. The rest of the areas in our opinion will be highly constrained until ID/RCP drawings are made available to us. By prioritizing in this way we are allowing adequate time for the professional team to develop the final design.

\section{Overall Planning}

At the initial stages of the project both the Main Contractor as well as the MEP Contractor benefit by planning the works geographically by area. However, it is best to also plan the works by service as in our experience, if this is not done the danger of services not being completed when milestones are reached such as ceiling closures we get into trouble.
