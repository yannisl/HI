\RE{HEE 901B/1.3/ZH/GK/17045 dated 1 aug 2013}

\setlength{\parskip}{\baselineskip}

We refer to DIWAN's letter Ref: DCC/DIWAN/Hlg/IIIA/bc/L0420 dated 8 Sep 2013. We note that the letter bears the initials of the Owner's MEP Projects Director and the contents of which the Engineer has adopted \textit{carte blanche}. At the onset we reject the contents of the letter outright. We expect the Engineer---being the gentleman he is---to refrain from allowing such correspondence to bear his signature, especially if they are directed towards persons rather than responding to issues and providing constructive resolutions. 

The referred to submittal is quoted out of context and the complimentary water meter submittal was in response to an EI issued by the Engineer and which the Engineer clearly stated "\textit{the outstanding works of this EI may be completed, together with other snagging items, after 'Substantial Completion' is awarded.}"  HLS pro-actively brought this activity forward. 

We once again urge the Engineer to review letters sent to the Contractor carefully and to avoid allowing person's in the Owner's Organization to hijack its role. We reserve all our rights to seek suitable redress according to the Qatari Civil Law against any Organizations and individuals that slander the good name of our Company and that of its subcontractors.
